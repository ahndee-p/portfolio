description: Strategic acquisitions for home services portfolio companies
---

In recent years private equity companies with deep pockets have set their eyes on the home services industry. A combination of surging demand for home services and a fragmented industry ripe for consolidation have been the catalysts for strong M&A activity that is expected to continue over the next several years.

As competition for strategic acquisitions heats up and the supply of attractive roofing businesses inevitably dries up, where might these well-heeled private equity firms choose to deploy their capital next?

My prediction is that the next logical move for these investors will be to start purchasing media companies in the home improvement space that have existing IP, audience loyalty and established content distribution networks.

Most home services companies rely primarily on paid advertising as their primary acquisition channel. Local owners with smaller budgets are being priced out of effectively competing for local attention as these portfolio-owned companies are able to raise bids across relevant local keywords and essentially blanket the entire area with their branding.

However as the industry begins to consolidate, winning market share through sheer brute force spending will have less and less ROI.

The portfolio companies that stand to win the most market share will be those that learn to differentiate themselves through higher quality ad creative and in new channels like SEO, areas where home services (and private equity) are traditionally weak.

And which potential non-industry acquisitions provide the most synergy in these areas?

## **1. Home Improvement Content Platforms**

Enter digital media platforms that focus on home improvement, DIY projects, and maintenance tips. Sites like The Spruce, House Digest, Home Talk, etc have been traditionally owned by digital media conglomerates like Red Ventures or DotDash Meredith, who essentially monetize through advertising.

Media companies are recently having trouble monetizing via traditional advertising methods as the business mode faces two significant headwinds:

1) Their primary acquisition channel (organic traffic) dries up
2) The unit economics don't allow for paid traffic acquisition.

Home services portfolio companies however would offer a different business model relying on vertical integration:

a) monetize directly through lead generation for their portfolio companies instead of relying so heavily on advertising. There is an opportunity for the home services brands to partner with home improvement media brands to create sponsored content with distribution already in place. The higher LTV of home services could allow for increased investment in paid acquisition for the media brands which would create more lead generation for the home services portfolio companies.

b) existing audiences with brand loyalty... these websites have large email lists and social media audiences that offer an excellent opportunity for home services companies to tap into to improve their national branding earlier in the customer awareness journey, outside of down funnel performance marketing channels.

c) inherit their existing content production infrastructure that portfolio companies could leverage to compete on SEO by creating higher quality content at scale. They could also compete more effectively in paid advertising by tapping into the creative teams that these media companies already have, instead of relying on agencies or in-house teams.

These websites have been battered recently from an organic traffic perspective which could mean they would be priced attractively.

## **2. Localized Review and Referral Platforms**

Investing in or acquiring platforms like _Angi_ (formerly Angie's List) or smaller localized review sites could directly integrate with your portfolio.

- **Opportunity**: Build trust with homeowners by showcasing verified reviews and referrals for your portfolio companies.
- **Benefit**: Use data from these platforms to identify underserved markets or high-demand services.
- **Monetization**: Premium placement for your businesses, subscription fees for enhanced listings.

## **3. Educational Platforms for DIY Skills**

Acquiring online learning platforms that teach DIY skills (e.g., plumbing basics, electrical repairs) could attract both customers and aspiring professionals.

- **Opportunity**: Platforms offering video tutorials or live classes on basic home maintenance skills.
- **Benefit**: Upsell professional services when DIY isn't feasible; recruit skilled laborers from engaged learners.
- **Monetization**: Subscription fees for courses or partnerships with tool manufacturers.
